# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

Roza is developing on dashboard on belly button diversity dashbaord for Improbable Beef a company who is developing synthetic beef.<br/>

She has a completed panel for demographic information and in order to visualize the bacterial data for each volunter that:<br/>

- Display all the key-value pairs of the selected individual’s demographic data,<br/>
- Identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons,<br/>
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.<br/>

That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza’s volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.<br/>

The Dashboard can be visualize on this page:  https://lskerrett.github.io/Belly_Button_Diversity/
